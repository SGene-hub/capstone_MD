   abstract = {The problem addressed in this paper is concerned with an important issue faced by any green aware global company to keep its emissions within a prescribed cap. The specific problem is to allocate carbon reductions to its different divisions and supply chain partners in achieving a required target of reductions in its carbon reduction program. The problem becomes a challenging one since the divisions and supply chain partners, being autonomous, may exhibit strategic behavior. We use a standard mechanism design approach to solve this problem. While designing a mechanism for the emission reduction allocation problem, the key properties that need to be satisfied are dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) (also called strategy-proofness), strict budget balance (SBB), and allocative efficiency (AE). Mechanism design theory has shown that it is not possible to achieve the above three properties simultaneously. In the literature, a mechanism that satisfies DSIC and AE has recently been proposed in this context, keeping the budget imbalance minimal. Motivated by the observation that SBB is an important requirement, in this paper, we propose a mechanism that satisfies DSIC and SBB with slight compromise in allocative efficiency. Our experimentation with a stylized case study shows that the proposed mechanism performs satisfactorily and provides an attractive alternative mechanism for carbon footprint reduction by global companies. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Carbon allowance auctions are a component of existing and proposed regional cap-and-trade programs in the United States and are also included in recent proposed bills in the U.S. Congress that would establish a national cap-and-trade program to regulate greenhouse gases ("carbon"). We discuss and evaluate the two leading candidates for auction format: a uniform-price sealed-bid auction and an ascending-bid dynamic auction, either of which could be augmented with a "price collar" to ensure that the price of allowances is neither too high nor too low. We identify the primary trade-offs between these two formats as applied to carbon allowance auctions and suggest additional auction design features that address potential concerns about efficiency losses from collusion and other factors. We conclude that, based on currently available evidence, a uniform-price sealed-bid auction is more appropriate for the sale of carbon allowances than the other leading auction formats, in part because it offers increased robustness to collusion without significant sacrifice of price discovery. © The Author 2011.

   abstract = {Carbon emission trading is an effective measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. China has publicized plans to initiate the demonstration of carbon emission trading in seven regions as of 2013. Initial allocation is fundamental, but it proposes difficulty in the mechanism design of the carbon emission trading system. Benchmark, grandfathering and the Shapley value have been employed to simulate a specific case, which consists of the initial allocation of carbon emission allowances of three power plants in Shanghai, China. The results of the Shapley value are regarded as a theoretical equitable reference. The results of benchmark are similar to those of the Shapley value. However, it is apparent that the allocation regarding grandfathering is inequitable. Considering other factors, we proposed the following: At the introduction of experimental stage, free allocation pertaining to grandfathering can be adopted; meanwhile, benchmark should be prepared and adopted at the appropriate time. Furthermore, a portion of the initial allowances can be reserved for auction, and this portion for auction will escalate to the extent of 100% upon entering the formal stage. In addition, the tiered price mechanism and the subsidy policy are also suggested.},

   abstract = {Reduction of carbon emissions is of paramount importance in the context of global warming and climate change. Countries and global companies are now engaged in understanding systematic ways of solving carbon economics problems, aimed ultimately at achieving well defined emission targets. This paper proposes mechanism design as an approach to solving carbon economics problems. The paper first introduces carbon economics issues in the world today and next focuses on carbon economics problems facing global industries. The paper identifies four problems faced by global industries: carbon credit allocation (CCA), carbon credit buying (CCB), carbon credit selling (CCS), and carbon credit exchange (CCE). It is argued that these problems are best addressed as mechanism design problems. The discipline of mechanism design is founded on game theory and is concerned with settings where a social planner faces the problem of aggregating the announced preferences of multiple agents into a collective decision, when the actual preferences are not known publicly. The paper provides an overview of mechanism design and presents the challenges involved in designing mechanisms with desirable properties. To illustrate the application of mechanism design in carbon economics, the paper describes in detail one specific problem, the carbon credit allocation problem.},

   abstract = {Reduction of carbon emissions is of paramount importance in the context of global warming. Countries and global companies are now engaged in understanding systematic ways of achieving well defined emission targets. In fact, carbon credits have become significant and strategic instruments of finance for countries and global companies. In this paper, we formulate and suggest a solution to the carbon allocation problem, which involves determining a cost minimizing allocation of carbon credits among different emitting agents. We address this challenge in the context of a global company which is faced with the challenge of determining an allocation of carbon credit caps among its divisions in a cost effective way. The problem is formulated as a reverse auction problem where the company plays the role of a buyer or carbon planning authority and the different divisions within the company are the emitting agents that specify cost curves for carbon credit reductions. Two natural variants of the problem: (a) with unlimited budget and (b) with limited budget are considered. Suitable assumptions are made on the cost curves and in each of the two cases we show that the resulting problem formulation is a knapsack problem that can be solved optimally using a greedy heuristic. The solution of the allocation problem provides critical decision support to global companies engaged seriously in green programs. © 2010 IEEE.},

   abstract = {What is the best way to auction an asset? How should a group of people organize themselves to ensure the best provision of public goods? How should exchanges be organized? This book addresses these questions and more through an exploration of the economic theory of mechanism design. Mechanism design is reverse game theory. Whereas game theory takes the rules of the game as a given and makes predictions about the behavior of strategic players, the theory of mechanism design goes a step further and selects the optimal rules of the game. A relatively new economic theory, mechanism design studies the instrument itself as well as the results of the instrument. This book provides explanations of classic results in the theory of mechanism design, such as Myerson's theorem on expected revenue maximizing auctions, Myerson and Satterthwaite's theorem on the impossibility of ex post efficient bilateral trade with asymmetric information, and Gibbard and Satterthwaite's theorem on the non-existence of dominant strategy voting mechanisms. It also provides an examination of the frontiers of current research in the area.},

A social choice rule (SCR) selects a set of feasible social states for each possible configuration of individual preferences and other characteristics. One interprets the choice set as the set of welfare optima. For example, given an Arrow social welfare function which embodies individual preferences in a social ordering, then a natural social choice rule is derived by maximizing this social ordering over the feasible set. Alternatively. the Pareto rule is the social choice rule which selects all Pareto efficient states, given individual preferences and the feasible set. These are two particular social choice rules which have received much attention, but our discussion will cover social choice rules in general.},

This chapter is intended as a self-sufficient introduction to mechanism design theory with the help of numerous stylized examples from network economics. The second part of the monograph contains an exposition of representative game theoretic problems in three different network economics situations and a systematic exploration of mechanism design solutions to these problems. This part has three chapters: Chapter 3 deals with the sponsored search auction problem, Chapter 4 with the resource allocation problem in computational grids, and Chapter 5 with the robust broadcast protocol design problem in ad hoc networks. The monograph concludes with Chapter 6 which provides several pointers to the relevant literature to facilitate a deeper and broader investigation of problem solving with mechanism design.},

   abstract = {China's national carbon emissions trading system (ETS) initially started by covering the power generation sector with a rate-based allocation of emission allowances. This single-sector ETS scheme is a tradable performance standard and loosens the participants' emission abatement effort. Given the stringent emission reduction targets implied by China's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the expectation that ETS will cover more sectors in the future, we simulate a national ETS of ten carbon-intensive sectors with mass-based, output-based allocation (OBA) of emission allowances. We uncover the impacts and mechanisms of this ETS by comparing the sectoral abatement behaviors across policy scenarios with varying allocation schemes and numbers of benchmarks. We evaluate if the simulated ETS meets important efficiency principles and exhibits desired features. The results show that this ETS achieves China's NDCs with modest macroeconomic losses. The mass-based OBA leads to evenly distributed emission reduction efforts for all ETS participating sectors. It also limits the emission trading volumes and results in slight to modest impacts on sectoral output, especially for the upstream sectors. OBA with fewer benchmarks enhances emission abatement efforts with the caveats of relatively cleaner participants being subsidized by the ETS and slightly higher impacts on the macroeconomy.},
